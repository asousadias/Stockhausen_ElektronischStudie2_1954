# Stockhausen's Elektronisches Studie II: Instrument simulation design
Csound and Max/MSP files proposing a simulation of the instruments used in Stockhausen's Elektronisch Studie II (1954)

Instrument simulation designed by 
Antonio de Sousa Dias

The Max/MSP patches and the Csound orchestras and scores provided here, show an attempt to simulate the techniques used by Stockhausen's Elektronisches Studie II (1954).

For the Csound version, there are two types of approach:

1- The first one (Version 1) follows the indicated pitch, harmonic structure, length and amplitude instructions.

2- The second one (version 2) proposes an instrument design simulating the technique employed by Stockhausen to obtain the sounds used in Elektronisches Studie II. Hence, the instrument designed simulates a slice tape editing where five tape fragments are assembled together and played trough a reverberation chamber.

You will notice the better results of this second version.

The Max/MSP implementation patch shows the same two approaches in real-time.
It consists in a monophonic synthesizer showing the same principles (that's the reason why you should let the notes sound untill the end, otherwise you will get artifacts.
